making the action go around their body
fluid and graceful
performed by quickly moving the action up and down in a consistent motion
process should be repeated until the action reaches the end of the string
used to keep the action spinning and to create momentum
showing off
person will need to give it a little tug to keep it from falling
let it spin around the axle
going in and out of their hand
repeat the steps as necessary
throwing the yo-yo down
producing a blur of color
yo-yo flutters on the string
precise and elegant
person making the action go under their leg
come back when you pull on the string
rotates on its axis as it moves
action the action around their body
going up and down the string
like a dancer spinning on stage
spin around the axle, going down towards the ground
smooth and fluid
throw the yo-yo forward and slightly upward
come back up again
circular pattern
spins around as it goes up and down
relaxing side to side motion
whining noise
string is now stretched out straight and is beginning to smoke
give it a slight tug to stop it from spinning
hangs motionless at the end of the string
spin around in a circle
